## How to bake a donut
This is recipe from https://domowe-wypieki.pl/przepisy/ciastka-male-wypieki/69-paczki-tradycyjne translated by google translate:
Ingredients for approx. 20 pieces:

Yeast dough:
- 500 g of wheat flour 
- 50 g of fresh yeast or 14 g of instant yeast 
- 100 g of butter (or margarine) 100 g of sugar 
- 4 egg yolks 
- 1 egg 
- 250 ml of milk 
- 1 tablespoon of spirit (vodka or rum)

Additionally:
- jam or jam (I used plum jam) 
- oil for frying (1-1.5 liters)

Prepare the leaven. Mix slightly warm milk with 1 teaspoon of sugar, crushed yeast and about 5 tablespoons of flour. Cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place to rise for about 10-15 minutes. Melt the butter (or margarine). Beat the yolks, egg and the rest of the sugar with steam in a water bath. (Beat for about 10 minutes. For steam whipping, read the notes). Pour the rest of the flour into a large bowl. Add the risen leaven and the egg mass. Start kneading the dough. While kneading, add melted butter. Knead the dough into a smooth, elastic mass. At the end add spirit and knead again. (The dough is very sticky. It's best not to add more flour.) Cover the bowl with the dough with a cloth and leave it in a warm place for about 40-60 minutes, until it doubles in size. Transfer the risen dough to a work surface sprinkled with flour and roll out to a thickness of approx. 1 cm. Cut circles with a diameter of 7 cm from it. (I used a glass). Put the filling on half of the discs and cover with the remaining discs. Seal the edges well. Place the donuts on a floured surface, cover with a cloth and leave to rise for about 30 minutes. Donuts should be light and fluffy.

Fry in batches in hot fat in a large pot on both sides. (There must be a lot of fat for the donuts to float freely in it. If the donuts are well puffed, a characteristic white ring will appear during baking. The temperature of the fat should be around 175 Â° C). Insert the donuts with the risen side down and fry for about 2 minutes on one side. Place the donuts on paper towels to drain the fat. Sprinkle the donuts with powdered sugar or glaze them. Fresh ones are the tastiest. (To make the frosting, mix 1 cup of sifted powdered sugar with enough hot water to obtain the frosting of the desired thickness. If it is too thin, add more powdered sugar, and if it is too thick, add a little water).

**Attention:**
If you want to prepare the egg mass in a water bath, you should choose two, not too small pots, where the smaller pot, when placed on the larger one, will stay on it well. Pour some water into the larger pot (enough so that when the smaller pot is placed on it, the water does not touch its bottom). Place the yolks, egg and sugar in a smaller pot. A pot of water should be boiled. When the water starts to boil, set the burner power to the lowest and put a smaller pot on it. Beat eggs with sugar with a hand mixer for about 10 minutes. The egg mass will rise and be very fluffy.
